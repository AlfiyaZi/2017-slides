# Share Your Code!

## Python Packaging without Complication
<br>
daveops.com/pycon2017

dave@forgac.com

@tylerdave

???
- Before I get started: I just want to note that I'm going to cover a lot of topics briefly
- I have these slides, notes, and links to further reading about everything I mention at the URL here
- And I'll have the URL up again at the end so if you miss it now you can get it then
- 

---

class: middle

```
def beautiful_code():
   """This code is so beautiful."""
    
   print('Hello, PyCon!')
```

???

- You write beautiful Python code
- If you think it'll be useful to others, you want to share it
- When you share it, you want to do it in a way that people to know how to download and use it
- And you may even want people to collaborate with you to make the code even better

---

class: middle, section-title

> &ldquo;I want to share my code!<br>What do I need to do?&rdquo;


???

- What do we need in order to do that? 

---

class: middle

# Package

???

- First, we need to package the code
- And then upload it to the package index
- This allows people to install it the way they expect, via pip

---

class: middle

# Documentation

???

- I also said that we want people to know how to use the code
- This means having documentation
- What else?

---

class: middle

# Source Hosting

???

- If we want people to be able to collaboarate with us to make the code better
- then we need to put the code somewhere people can access it
- This typically means putting it on GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, or another provider

---

class: middle 

# Tests

???
- And we want to make sure the when people make changes they don't break things
- So we need tests

---

class: middle

# CI

???
- we want the tests to be run automaticlaly 
- so we can see if any incoming contributions breaks things
- so we should set up a continuous integration service to run our tests

---

class: middle

# License

???
- we should have a license so people know under what terms they can use the code

---

class: middle

# Contributing

???
- we should probably have contributing instructions so people know how to go about helping
- this should include things like
- should they open an issue first?
- submit a pull request?
- what kind of things do you want help with?

---

class: padded-top

## we need

Code

Package

Documentation

Source Hosting

Tests

CI

License

Contributing

???

- Now we have a list of things we need to do to share our code

---

class: middle, section-title

> &ldquo;But I just wanted to share my code!&rdquo;


???
- at this point you may be thinking that setting up all of this sounds like a lot of work
- and you know it would be

---

class: padded-top2

# TL;DR

???
- If you only take one thing away from this talk, I hope it's this:
- Because someone has already done a lot of work to get these things set up for you

--

![Cookiecutter](assets/cookiecutter_logo.png)

???
- Use cookiecutter
- cookiecutter is a tool that allows you to make new projects from templates
- templates can be for any kind of project but there a number of good ones for python packages -- i have one linked with the notes
- My recommendation is to start with a template that's close to what you want
- fork it, and then updated it for your preferences
- you can then use that when you make new projects

---

class: center, middle, section-title

# Terminology

???
- before we go any further I want to go over some terminology just to make sure we're using the same language. 

---

class: center, middle

# Module

## Saved Python code

???
- Anything importable from a file

---

class: center, middle

# Import Package

## namespace / directory

???
- Just a directory structure for organizing python modules

---

class: center, middle

# Distribution Package

## Shareable / installable

???
- Then a distribution package is your code
- bundled-up in a way that it can be shared and installed
- This talk is about sharing your code so for the rest of the talk the term "package" refers to one of these
- of course to make things more complex there are multiple types of distrubtion packages

---

class: center, middle

# Source Distribution

## sdist

???
- a source distribution contains bundled source code
- this includes extension source if you have extensions in anohter language like C
- when you install a source distribution any extensions are complied at install time

---

class: center, middle

# Built Distribution

## Wheel

???
- built distributions are built or compiled beforehand so they just need to be unpacked at install time
- eggs are an older format may see referenced
- but wheels are the current built distribution format and you should be making them for your projects
- for a while the package index only supported uploading weels for windows and mac
- more recently the manylinux platform tag was developed
- it defines a lowest-common denominator linux interface which allows wheels to be built that will work on most linux systems

---

class: center, padded-top

# Wheel

???
- and of course there are multiple types of wheels too
--

## Universal

???
- a universal wheel is one that contains only python code and is compatible with python 2 and 3
--

## Pure Python

???
- a pure python wheel is specific to either 2 or 3 but is still only python code
--

## Platform

???
- a platform wheel has compiled code so it's specific to a target platform
- one has to be created for every platform on which you want to 

---

class: padded-top

# History

???
- this is the extremely short version of packaging history
- the packaging ecosystem grew organically and for a long time it wasn't clear what was considered the current best practice
- if you searched online you'd find lots of conflicting information about how to do things
--

## Copy / Replace

???
- so the way i'd go about packaging  was: i'd find a project that seemed to have it together and make a copy
- and then replace their code with mine and then change the project name in the files
--


## PyPA 

???
- then in 2011 the packaging authority working group was created to take over maintenance of core packaging tools
- and they've since worked to make some great improvements to the packaging ecosystem
--

## PyPUG
`https://packaging.python.org/`

???
- besides the specification and tooling improvements, another major contribution of the working group is maintenance of the python packaging user guide
- so we finally have an authoritative resource for how we should be creating and installing packages

---

class: middle, section-title

> &ldquo;Let's make a package!&rdquo;

???

- Let's make a package for our code

---

class: padded-top

## Using cookiecutter

```no-highlight
$ cookiecutter cookiecutter-python-package
…
full_name (default is "Dave Forgac")?
email (default is "tylerdave@tylerdave.com")?
github_username (default is "tylerdave")?
project_name (default is "Example")? Example Package
repo_name (default is "boilerplate")? Example-Package
project_short_description (default is "A short description")?
 Example package for PyCon talk.
release_date (default is "2017-05-21")?
year (default is "2017")?
version (default is "0.1.0")?
```

???
- when you use cookiecutter it prompts you for some information about your project
- and then generates a directory structure for your project customized with your input

---

class: center, middle

## Layout

├── setup.cfg
├── setup.py
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_sample.py
```

???
- here is an overview of the files that make up a minimal package
- most templates will have more but we'll take a look at these files first

---

class: center, middle

## Code

```no-highlight

├── setup.cfg
├── setup.py
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_sample.py
```


???
- The first part is your code
- the directory was created by cookiecutter and then the code was copied into it
- a common pattern is to store your code in an import package with the same name as the project

---

class: center, middle

## setup.py

```no-highlight
.
├── data

│   └── package_data.dat
├── setup.cfg
*├── setup.py
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_sample.py
```


???
- most important file for packaging and distribution
- has info about the package that's used during installation and by the package index
- note that it's just python code and that it's executed during installation
- this would allow you to do some fancy things
- but don't do fancy things

---

class: center, middle

## setup.cfg

```no-highlight

*├── setup.cfg
├── setup.py
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_sample.py
```


???
- configuration file to go along with setup.py
- it's commonly used for configuring wheel building options and configuration for packaging related plugins and tooling 

---

class: center, middle

## MANIFEST.in

```no-highlight
.
├── data
│   └── data_file

├── setup.cfg
├── setup.py
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_sample.py
```


???
- by default your python code will be included when you build a distrubtion package
- but if you need any non-python files to be included they need to be listed in MANIFEST.in
- this is typically used for things like data files, configuration, and docs

---

class: center, middle

## README.rst

```no-highlight
.
├── data
│   └── data_file
├── DESCRIPTION.rst
├── MANIFEST.in

│   └── package_data.dat
├── setup.cfg
├── setup.py
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_sample.py
```


???
- the README is what people see when they browse your project on source hosting like github
- it's also commonly used as the long discription for the package index
- it should contain general information about what your code does, basic usage instructions, and where to find more info like a link to your docs

---

## setup.py (1/2)

```
*from setuptools import setup, find_packages
*	 
*setup(
    name='Example Package',
    version='0.1.0',     # PEP440-compliant version
    description='Example package for PyCon talk.',
    long_description='Displayed on PyPI project page.',
    url='https://github.com/tylerdave/Example-Package',
    author='Dave Forgac',
    author_email='tylerdave@tylerdave.com',
    packages=find_packages(exclude=['docs', 'tests'])
    install_requires=['requests'],
    package_data={
        'sample': ['package_data.dat']
        }
    …
```

???
- now let's take a look at a setup.py
- we import setup and optionally find_packages from setuptools
- then the packaging settings are defined as arguments to the setup function

---

## setup.py (1/2)

```
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
	 
setup(
*   name='Example Package',
*   version='0.1.0',     # PEP440-compliant version
*   description='Example package for PyCon talk.',
*   long_description='Displayed on PyPI project page.',
*   url='https://github.com/tylerdave/Example-Package',
*   author='Dave Forgac',
*   author_email='tylerdave@tylerdave.com',
    packages=find_packages(exclude=['docs', 'tests'])
    install_requires=['requests'],
    package_data={
        'sample': ['package_data.dat']
        }
    …
```

???
- then we define basic package meta-information
- like name of project
- a description of the project
- the version number
- author information
- long_description
- often you'll see long_description loaded from README / DESCRIPTION
---

## setup.py (1/2)

```
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
	 
setup(
    name='Example Package',
    version='0.1.0',     # PEP440-compliant version
    description='Example package for PyCon talk.',
    long_description='Displayed on PyPI project page.',
    url='https://github.com/tylerdave/Example-Package',
    author='Dave Forgac',
    author_email='tylerdave@tylerdave.com',
*   packages=find_packages(exclude=['docs', 'tests'])
    install_requires=['requests'],
    package_data={
        'sample': ['package_data.dat']
        }
    …
```

???
- then we define what import packages should be included in the distribution
- they can be listed manually but the find_package we imported above will do it for you
- if you use it you exclude things that aren't meant to be installed
---

## setup.py (1/2)

```
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
	 
setup(
    name='Example Package',
    version='0.1.0',     # PEP440-compliant version
    description='Example package for PyCon talk.',
    long_description='Displayed on PyPI project page.',
    url='https://github.com/tylerdave/Example-Package',
    author='Dave Forgac',
    author_email='tylerdave@tylerdave.com',
    packages=find_packages(exclude=['docs', 'tests'])
*   install_requires=['requests'],
    package_data={
        'sample': ['package_data.dat']
        }
    …
```

???
- install_requires is what is used to determine the dependencies of your package at install time
- so when you pip install the package, things listed here will be installed
- note that this is different from requirements.txt we'll look at that in a moment but i've linked to a page with more details about the distinctions in the notes

---

## setup.py (1/2)

```
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
	 
setup(
    name='Example Package',
    version='0.1.0',     # PEP440-compliant version
    description='Example package for PyCon talk.',
    long_description='Displayed on PyPI project page.',
    url='https://github.com/tylerdave/Example-Package',
    author='Dave Forgac',
    author_email='tylerdave@tylerdave.com',
    packages=find_packages(exclude=['docs', 'tests'])
    install_requires=['requests'],
*   package_data={
*       'sample': ['package_data.dat']
*       }
    …
```

???
- then package data allows you to define extra files that will be included in your pacakge
- they are exposed to your code via the name on the left so you don't have to worry about calculating paths

---

## setup.py (2/2)

```no-highlight
    …
*   entry_points={
*       'console_scripts': [
*           'hello=example_package.cli:say_hello',
*       ],
*   }
    license='MIT',
    classifiers=[
        'Development Status :: 3 - Alpha',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 2',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 2.7',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.4',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.5',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6',
    ])
```

???
- Entry points defines interfaces that your package provides
- this is commonly used for defining plugins
- console_scripts is a special type of entry point
- it creates commands that map command names on the left to your python code on the right
- it's good to use this because it does the right thing depending on the OS
- on linux and mac it'll create a wrapper script and put it on the path
- on windows it'll create a small exe file that knows how to find the right code

---

## setup.py (2/2)

```no-highlight
    …
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'hello=example_package.cli:say_hello',
        ],
    }
*   license='MIT',
    classifiers=[
        'Development Status :: 3 - Alpha',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 2',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 2.7',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.4',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.5',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6',
    ])
```

???
- Indicate the license under which your code is released
- Then the classifiers section lists categorization information about the package
- this is typically used to indicate which versions of python you intend to support
- but as of now nothing is enforced based on this information
---

## setup.py (2/2)

```no-highlight
    …
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [

```

???
- Indicate the license under which your code is released
- Then the classifiers section lists categorization information about the package
- this is typically used to indicate which versions of python you intend to support
- but as of now nothing is enforced based on this information

???
- install_requires ensures dependencies are met
- package_data is mapping pkg name to relative path
- data_files can specify data outside of your path

- scripts can specify an individual script
- entry_points is used for dynamic plugin discovery
- most common entry_point is console scripts
- console scripts makes an executable wrapper

---

class: padded-top

## setup.cfg

```
[bdist_wheel]
universal = 1                
    
[flake8]
exclude = docs
```

???
- the setup.cfg file contains additional packaging settings
- here we see settings for wheel building
- and for the plugin flake8

---

class: padded-top

## MANIFEST.in

```
include LICENSE
include README.rst
    
recursive-include tests *
recursive-exclude * __pycache__
recursive-exclude * *.py[co]
```

???
- manifest.in lists files that should be included or excluded on top of what setuptools finds

---

## README.rst

===============================
Example Package
===============================

Documentation: https://example.com
    
Usage
-----
    
``sample --help``
    
```

???
- the readme is in restructured text format and 

---

class: center, middle

# LICENSE

???
- If you're publishing your code, you need a license
- Coose from one of the common OS licenses unless your laywer tells you otherwise 
- include it in a file named license and reference it in your README and setup.py

---

class: center, middle

# Tests

`./tests`

<br>
`tox.ini`

???
- even if this is just an experimental project, you need tests
- but at minimum, test that the most basic use case works as expected
- then if you're looking to improve coverage, note that you want help with tests in your contributing instructions
- people are a lot more likely to expand on existing tests than they are to create them for you from scratch
- your template should include configuration for running your tests
- in my case using tox

---

class: center, middle

# Docs

`./docs`

???
- like tests you should have at least basic usage documentation
- again, people are a lot more likely to add to existing documentation than they are to add docs wholesale
- the templates will give you good structure for your documentation and you should at least fill in the usage information

---

class: center, middle

# CI

`.travis.yml`

???
- the template should include configuration for your CI service
- i use travis ci by default but if you have a different service your template should have configuration for that

---

class: center, middle

# requirements.txt

???
- this serves a different purpose than the install_requires in setup.py
- this is generally a list of dependencies used by developers
- a great tool for managing this is called pip-tools
- i have a link to it in my further reading

---

# PyPI

`https://pypi.python.org/`

???
- create an account on pypi
- you'll use this when uplading packages

--

# Test PyPI
`https://testpypi.python.org/`

???
- note that there's a test instance of the package index
- so if you want to experiment with the upload process you can do it there without adding more junk to the real index 

---

## Save PyPI Settings

`$HOME/.pypirc`

```no-highlight
[distutils]
index-servers=pypi
  
[pypi]
repository = https://pypi.python.org/pypi
username = <username>
password = <password>
```

???
- to make things easier for you
- you should save some settings in a .pypirc file in your home directory
- Can omit password and the tools will prompt you for them instead 
- Can configure alternate indexes

# Virtualenv

## pew

## virtualenvwrapper

???
- should work in a virtualenv
- check out pew or virtualenvwrapper to make things easier for you

---

## Packaging Tools

`pip install wheel`

`pip install twine`

???
- depending on your environment you may need to install wheel
- and install twine, which is a tool for uploading your packages to the index


---

class: center, middle

## Build dist. files

`./setup.py sdist`

`./setup.py bdist_wheel`

or

`make dist`

???
- run commands to build distrubiton files
- if you use one of the default templates it'll give you a Makefile that includes make dist

---

class: center, middle

## Upload

`twine upload dist/*`

???
- twine will register the package if it's not already registered
- and then upload your distribution files
- you should use twine because the upload command that's built into setup.py is insecure

---

class: middle

# Install

`pip install example-package`

???
- now you can install your package via pip

---

class: center, middle

## Develop Mode

```no-highlight
./setup.py develop
```

or

```no-highlight
pip install -e .
```

???
- going-forward you can install your package in editable development mode
- this will make it so that you can edit your code and see the changes in your virtualenv without reinstalling
- note that if you change the entry points at all you do need to re-run the install command

---

class: middle

# Rinse, Repeat

???
- then you can change your code
- update the version
- commit and push
- verify tests are passing
- build distribution files
- upload them to pypi

---

class: middle

# Versions

## bumpversion

## versioneer

???
- two tools that take different approaches to this are bumpversion and versioneer

---

class: padded-top

# Recap
--

## ~~DIY~~

???
- don't set up all this stuff by hand
- use existing templates

--

## Use the tools

???
- take the time to set up tools and services that will make your life easier in the long run

--

## Share your code!
???
- share your code so other people can benefit from the cool stuff you do
